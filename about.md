### Who is that guy?

Father of a wonderful girl I settled in Utrera, Spain I work in [TU][tu]
inside of **Telefonica&nbsp;I+D** as Mobile Developer,
I've been working developing mobile apps more than 4 years and
I have some side projects active where usually apply new techniques and paradigms.
I have been working also in various videogames for PS4/PS3/Vita.

### What are you gonna found here?

I'm a Software Developer, specialized in Native Mobile Applications,
in their main flavors (Android/iOS), due of that, I have interest on frameworks/tools that help
me develop multiplatform applications like [Xamarin][xamarin]

When develop, you should see lot of buzzword, I try to apply (sometimes I cannot do all that I want)
**SOLID** principles, follow my own approach of a **Clean Architecture**, I love play with **Reactive Programing** and **MVVM**, all of that covered with some **Unit Test**, in general, like a sector teammate said, I try to use everything that let's me sleep at night with the knowlege that I don't break nothing during the day.
